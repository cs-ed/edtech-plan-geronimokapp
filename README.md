# Educational Technology Plan

This plan will serve as a guide to implement an introductory course to computer science in a K-8 school setting. The plan will utilize literacy skills as a vehicle to teach computer science fundamnetals. 

## Context

### Course

The course will build upon students' prior knowlege of literacy skills while applying them to the new content knowledge of computer science. This will be an opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of various texts while learning how codeing and computers systems work. The class will be designed as an enrichment course to existing content and will serve as a support to the literacy component of the curriculum. The course will primarily be aimed at 6-8th graders, but ideally will be open to upper elementary students in need of a new challenge or interested in learning about computer science.

### Situation

As all students at our school have their own Chromebook, this will be the primary tool they use to complete assignments and expore the projects. The class will be heald for 45-50 minute periods at least twice a week as an enrichement course. All students wil have access to the class at some point in the school year but it will be on a rotionala basis due to time and teacher constraints. Not all students will be taking the class at the same time, but all will have access at some point in the year. Lessons and activities will need to be designed in such a way as to maximaize the timeframe available. Our sstudent population is a mix of many levels and will need to be able to include mainstreemed special education studcents and students with IEPs.

## Plan

### Software Specifications
-Students use ChromeOS
-Teachers use MacOS
-[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
-Google Classroom
-Infinite Campus Gradebook

### Hardware Specifications
-Chromebooks 1.1 GHz Celeron N3450 32 GB Hard Drive 4 GB Ram
-Macbook Air 1.2 GHz Quad -Core Intel Core i7 16 GB memory 250.69 HD storage
-Wifi network
-Projector
-applicable dongles
-speakers

### Application

Students will build capacity and confidence with coding and computer technolgy specific vocabulary through various problets and labs. The culmnination will be a project where-in students work in small groups to produce a animated re-telling of a story or game demonstrating a thoroough understand of the story and its various characters along with a predetermined set of coding tasks. The project will be presented to classmantes and the school community as a whole via our school's website. The students will work in class via their chromebooks to complete assignmnets. As not all students have equal access to internet and technology at home, all work will need to be abel to be completed in class. No specific homework assignments will be required. Assessments will consist of vocabulary and knowledge of fundamental components of computers, but the majority of the students' grade wiull be assessed via the quality of their project.  

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
