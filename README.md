# Educational Technology Plan

This plan will serve as a guide to implement an introductory course to computer science in a K-8 school setting. The plan will utilize literacy skills as a vehicle to teach computer science fundamentals. 

## Context

### Course

The course will build upon students' prior knowlege of literacy skills while applying them to the new content knowledge of computer science. This will be an opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of various texts while learning how coding and computers systems work. The class will be designed as an enrichment course to existing content and will serve as a support to the literacy component of the curriculum. The course will primarily be aimed at 6-8th graders, but ideally will be open to upper elementary students in need of a new challenge or interested in learning about computer science.

### Situation

As all students at our school have their own Chromebook, this will be the primary tool they use to complete assignments and explore the projects. The class will be held for 45-50 minute periods at least twice a week as an enrichment course. All students will have access to the class at some point in the school year but it will be on a rotational basis due to time and teacher constraints. Not all students will be taking the class at the same time, but all will have access at some point in the year. Lessons and activities will need to be designed in such a way as to maximaize the timeframe available. Our student population is a mix of many levels and will need to be able to include mainstreemed special education students and students with IEPs.

### Application

Students will build capacity and confidence with coding and computer technolgy specific vocabulary through various problets and labs. The culmnination will be a project where-in students work in small groups to produce a animated re-telling of a story or game demonstrating a thorough understanding of the story and its various characters along with a predetermined set of coding tasks. The project will be presented to classmates and the school community as a whole via our school's website. The students will work in class via their chromebooks to complete assignmnets. As not all students have equal access to internet and technology at home, all work will need to be able to be completed in class. No specific homework assignments will be required. Assessments will consist of vocabulary and knowledge of fundamental components of computers, but the majority of the students' grade will be assessed via the quality of their project.  


### Impacts

The impact of my plan centers on the introduction of new skills within computer science and coding while also reinforcing literacy capabilities with the students. The students will benefit from a novel way to demonstrate their reading competencies while gaining valuable skills in computer science. All students will be able to demonstrate growth in both fields of studies and increase motivation to learn and understand how computers work.
Many students at our school site exhibit a low level of motivation to read. This combination of computer science and reading instruction will offer a new way to increase student interest in demonstrating reading comprehension. For students reluctant to read this plan offers a way to get them reading about an area of study that interests them. They will likely be actively reading without even realizing it. Additionally, students who are neurologically divergent and students with IEPs will have another way to demonstrate their understanding, increasing the options for differentiation. 
One primary strength of this plan is in its flexibility to meet the needs of all students. Regardless of reading ability all students will be able to demonstrate comprehension via this plan when given appropriate texts to analyze and interest levels. Moving away from the more traditional methods of demonstrating comprehension of the text will further the options for students. Adolescents in general benefit from given choice and autonomy in their schooling experience and this plan delivers flexible choice.   
Another strength of this plan is in its fostering of creativity for all students. All students will benefit from exercising their creativity in designing and building their projects. Thinking not only about what form their final project will take but also taking into consideration their targeted audience all while demonstrating their understanding of a text requires them to use creativity. Many students thrive when given creative exercises and will produce remarkable work atypical for them as individuals. 
Furthermore, this plan reflects our current blended learning model seen more and more in classrooms. Students benefit from a more non-traditional model to demonstrate their learning. Moving away from straight lecture and paperwork of a traditional classroom model to a blending of short instruction or video lessons to labs and padlets that help students practice the fundamental skills needed to complete a larger project will be attractive to a wide range of students. Giving them space to make independent decisions and plans helps foster autonomy and resilience. Being able to reflect, recognize when one needs more help, and communicate effectively those needs are skills many students need to develop as they get older.
